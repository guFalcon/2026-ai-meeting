/**
 * This class is a Debouncer allowing you to debounce any function calls happening in short succession.
 * The debouncer has a timeout in milliseconds (default is null) and it ensures that the debounced functions will
 * only be called once every [timeout] time.
 * If timeout is not set, then the debounced functions will be called immediately and the 'timeout' will only be
 * over when the last function call has been executed, either successfully or not.
 * When the first debounce-call happens, that function gets executed immediately and a timer is started.
 * When another debounce happens within [timeout] time of the first one, then that function gets saved and will be
 * executed later on. The function that may have been in this waiting-position before that, will be discarded
 * (that's where de debouncing actually happens).
 * After the timeout has run out, the last saved function will be finally executed, triggering yet another timeout.
 * (If meanwhile another debounce-call happens, the waiting-position won't be vacant any longer and at the end another
 * timeout will be started, and so on, and so forth...)
 * This way you never lose the last function call (because of eventual consistency and stuff).
